## 🔢 Guess the Number (1 to 100)

**How to Play:**
- The computer will randomly pick a number between 1 and 100.
- Your goal is to guess the number in as few attempts as possible.
- After each guess, you'll get feedback:
  - `"Too low!"` if your guess is smaller than the number.
  - `"Too high!"` if your guess is greater than the number.
  - `"Correct!"` when you guess it right 🎉
- The game ends when you guess correctly, and it shows the number of attempts taken.
